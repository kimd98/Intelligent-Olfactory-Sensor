# Intelligent Olfactory Sensor

This personal research has been motivated by Phylira, an AI solution to create new fragrances developed by IBM researchers and Symrise, and the article about olfactory sensor technologies written by ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Trends).

There are various types of olfactory intelligence applications and the perfume and fragrances market is one of them. This project uses a Machine Learning technique for a olfactory sensor to digitize and distinguish the sense of smell. Since anything that smells fragrant releases VOCs into the air, CCS811, an ultra-low power digital gas sensor solution that senses a wide range of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs), will be used as a main component of the sensor. Various scent samples will be collected and used for deep learning with TensorFlow. If the sensor successfully detects the smell and tells the difference between different samples, then actual perfume products will be used to test the sensor. Also, data from the samples will be visualized and represented on the S-Catcher web app, the online encyclopedia of perfume and fragrances.
